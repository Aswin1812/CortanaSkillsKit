# Using adaptive cards with Cortana  

Adaptive Cards are an open card exchange format, enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way. They are supported by several [Azure Bot Service channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/getting-started/bots) (like Cortana, Teams, and Skype), Windows Timeline, and [Actionable Messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages) (including Outlook and Office 365).

Start using Adaptive Cards to enhance your voice experience on devices with screens:

1. Visit [AdaptiveCards.io](https://adaptivecards.io/) to get an overview. View samples.
1. Try the [Adaptive Card designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to build cards, without writing a line of code.
1. See how to send Adaptive Card attachments on bot messages in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-add-media-attachments?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp) or [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-add-media-attachments?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=javascript).
1. Learn how to make your Adaptive Cards speak, using [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/CSharp/V4Patches) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/Node/V4Patches).
