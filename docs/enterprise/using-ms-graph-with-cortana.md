# Leverage Microsoft Graph with your Cortana skill 

Microsoft Graph unifies API access to the services in Microsoft 365 products. Developers can now consume data through a single [public endpoint](https://graph.microsoft.com), either by using simple REST calls, or with an SDK that's available on multiple platforms (see the list on the [Get started with Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/get-started) page). Authentication models are standardized. Permissions are secure, granted using OAuth protocols. And some Microsoft Graph data schemas are extensible, enabling support for custom applications.

To integrate Microsoft Graph into your Cortana skills, follow these steps:

1. Get an [overview](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph) of the features.
1. Try [sample queries](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) with the easy-to-use explorer, without writing a line of code.
1. See examples of how to use [Microsoft Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios) with Cortana, using OAuth in either [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/CSharp/OAuth2Example) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/Node/OAuth2Example).
1. See examples of Cortana skills that use Microsoft Graph, either in [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/CSharp/OutlookGraph) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/Node/OutlookGraph).
