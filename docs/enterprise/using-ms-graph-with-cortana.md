# Leverage Microsoft Graph with your Cortana skill  

Microsoft Graph unifies API access to the services in the Microsoft 365 suite.  Developers can now consume data through a single public endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.com) – using simple REST calls or with an SDK available on just about any platform.  Authentication models are standardized.  Permissions are secure, granted using OAuth protocols.  And some Microsoft Graph data schemas are extensible – enabling support for custom applications.

To integrate Microsoft Graph into your Cortana skills, follow these steps:
1. Get an [overview](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph) of the features. Try [samples](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) with the easy-to-use explorer (without writing a line of code).
1. See examples of how to use [Microsoft Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios) using OAuth with Cortana in [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/CSharp/OAuth2Example) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/Node/OAuth2Example)
