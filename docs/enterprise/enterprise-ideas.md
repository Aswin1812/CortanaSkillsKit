# Ideas for using Cortana in the enterprise

Commonly questions from developers are "What can Cortana do?" and "What can we build?"

If you invoke Cortana and say, “What can I do?”, Cortana will list out examples related to calendar, reminders, email, lists, alarms, timers, search,places, language translation, facts, simple math, dictionary, device automation, PC and web navigation, news, and more.

You can build whatever you want, because bots allow you to integrate with any open or authenticated service, so long as you have a reasonable language model and deterministic responses.
