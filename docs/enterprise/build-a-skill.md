# Build an enterprise skill

There is very little difference in the way that consumer and enterprise skills are built. Go on off to [Getting started with Cortana skills](../skills/get-started.md) and build the heck out of one.

After you're done, come back to [Test and debug](enterprise-test-and-debug.md).
