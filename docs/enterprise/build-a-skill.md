# Build an enterprise skill

There's very little difference in the way that consumer and enterprise skills are built. Testing and debugging are different,though, so begin with [Getting started with Cortana skills](../skills/get-started.md) to build one.

When you're done with that, come back to [Test and debug](enterprise-test-and-debug.md).
