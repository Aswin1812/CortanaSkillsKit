# Adding Cortana as a service principal

If you use the “deploy to security groups” feature of enterprise skills, you need to allow Cortana visibility to those groups. This is done by an IT administrator adding Cortana as a service principal.

>[!NOTE]
>For information about service principals in Azure, see [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals).

- Open Powershell in administrator mode. <**In the word doc, the word "Powershell" is linked to a script. Are they supposed to use that?**>
- Unless it's already installed, you need to run `Install-Module AzureAD`.
- <**So this PS cmdlet (Connect-AzureAD) is what actually does the work, correct?**>`Connect-AzureAD New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId "5bea582d-897e-4ace-a2f0-d9a883bbde3d" -DisplayName "Cortana Enterprise"` <**Is that GUID always going to be the same?**>
