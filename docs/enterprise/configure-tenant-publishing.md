## Deployment Configuration

- Deploy to entire tenant – publishes the enterprise skill to everyone
- Deploy to security groups – publishes the enterprise skill only to members of the associated security groups

>[!NOTE] In order for security groups to work, Cortana must be added as a service principal in your tenant by an IT administrator. See [Adding Cortana as a service principal](enterprise-cortana-service-principal.md) in the Appendix.

Once you've filled in all the required fields on the page, click `Submit for Review` to send the skill off to your administrators for certification. Alternatively, you can save this information at any point by pressing the `Save` button. Then you can return to the page and edit it at any time before you submit it for certification and publishing. Keep in mind that once it's submitted, the skill configuration cannot be changed.
