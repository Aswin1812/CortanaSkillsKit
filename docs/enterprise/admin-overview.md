# IT Admin Cortana Overview

Many enterprises have policies for computers (devices) or users that join the domain that control what those entities can and cannot do. Cortana is presently controlled at a computer level. For Cortana configuration, please refer to

• [Cortana at Work Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/cortana-at-work/cortana-at-work-overview)

• [Cortana at Work Policy Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/cortana-at-work/cortana-at-work-policy-settings)

for the use cases and policies used to control Cortana in the enterprise.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before you can begin developing enterprise skills for Cortana, your enterprise must be onboarded by Microsoft. See [Enterprise onboarding](onboarding.md) for details.
