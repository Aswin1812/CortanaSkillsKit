# Enterprise onboarding

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Enterprise skills require that your enterprise and developers be enrolled with Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts. Please see the [Cortana integration in your business or enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/cortana-at-work/cortana-at-work-overview) page for details.

In order to create internal enterprise skills, Microsoft must onboard both the enterprise and its developers. This requires you to send information to Microsoft. Please email the following information to cortanae@microsoft.com in order to get your Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant onboarded to this program.

* AAD Tenant Name
* AAD Tenant ID
* IT Admin Name, email address, and AAD Object ID

Once the tenant is onboarded, developers can begin to build Cortana Enterprise Skills for your organization.
