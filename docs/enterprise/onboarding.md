# Onboarding your enterprise

Before your developers can create skills for your enterprise, both your enterprise and the developers must have Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts. Please see the [Cortana integration in your business or enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/cortana-at-work/cortana-at-work-overview) page for details.

Once the AAD accounts have been created, Microsoft must onboard your enterprise in order for your developers to be able to create internal enterprise skills. Onboarding requires you to send information to Microsoft. Please email the following information to cortanae@microsoft.com:

* AAD Tenant Name
* AAD Tenant ID
* IT Admin Name, email address, and AAD Object ID

Once the tenant is onboarded, developers can begin to build Cortana Enterprise Skills for your organization. This is the only step that requires Microsoft's assistance. After the tenant is set up, your IT Admins are responsible for making sure that developers have the privileges they need.
