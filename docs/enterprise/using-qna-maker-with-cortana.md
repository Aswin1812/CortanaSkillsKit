# Using QnA Maker to create a skill  

[Question and Answer Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) converts lists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) into Azure Bot Service bots in minutes via an easy-to-use portal. After creating the QnA Maker Knowledge Base, and deploying a sample bot or template, you can easily modify a few lines of code in the bot to add speech.

Follow these three steps to create a QnA Maker skill for Cortana:
1. Read the QnA Maker page [overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/overview/overview) to understand the process, and make your first Knowledge Base.
1. See the Azure Bot Service documentation and code examples in the [Use QnA Maker to answer questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-qna?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs) page. You'll learn how to attach the Knowledge Base to a bot.
1. Learn how to update QnA Maker bot code to use speech. There are examples for both [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/CSharp/V4Patches) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/cortana-skills-samples/tree/master/Consumer/Node/V4Patches).
