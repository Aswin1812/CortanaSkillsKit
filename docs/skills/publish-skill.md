# Publishing Cortana skills

>[!NOTE]
> This article describes the three deployment groups in Cortana and how to publish a Cortana skill. You should create a Cortana skill before proceeding.

> If you have never created a Cortana skill and need to get started, visit the [Create your first skill](./get-started.md) page.

Deploy your Cortana skill to each of the three deployment groups.
* [Default Settings](#default-settings)
* [Test Group Settings](#test-group-settings)
* [World Settings](#world-settings)

All deployment groups contain the same instance of your Cortana skill.
Two identifiers are assigned to your Cortana skill.
* `skillId`:  The identifier (ID) of your Cortana skill is unique per deployment group. If your skill checks the ID, then verify the IDs are different for each group. Use the ID of your Cortana skill if you want to turn on additional logging for the group environment.
* `skillProductId`: The product ID of your Cortana skill is unique across deployment groups.

Cortana passes these IDs in the channel information of the message.

## Cortana Configuration Fields

## Default Settings

After configuring the Cortana channel for your skill, it's automatically deployed to **Default Settings**. Deploying to **Default Settings** makes the skill available to you only, so you can thoroughly test it before deploying it to one of the other environments.

For more information about configuring the Cortana channel, visit the [Connect a bot to Cortana](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-cortana?view=azure-bot-service-3.0) page.

![Default settings](./media/images/default_settings.png)

1. On the *Configure Cortana* page, under the *Default Settings* section, enter the following information.

    Complete the required fields (marked with an asterisk).

    For more information about the bot configuration fields, visit the [Connect a bot to Cortana](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-cortana) page.

    * `Display name`: The value is limited to 30 characters.
    * `Invocation name`: The name used to invoke your Cortana skill. This value must be unique across Cortana (all Cortana skills).

        For more information about invocation naming, visit the [Invocation Name Guidelines](./cortana-invocation-guidelines.md) page.

    1. Manage user identity through Connected Services
    ![Manage user identity through Connected Services](./media/images/default_settings-manage_user_identity_connected_services-off.png)

        `Cortana should manage my user's identity`: If you select this option, then you must complete the following fields.

        ![Manage user identity through Connected Services](./media/images/default_settings-manage_user_identity_connected_services-on.png)

    * `When should Cortana prompt for a user to sign in?`
        * `Sign in at invocation`: The user signs in once, and the authorization token will be passed as needed.
        * `Sign in when required`: The user will be asked to sign in whenever necessary.

    * `Account name`: The name of your Account.

    * `Client ID for third-party services`: The application ID of your bot.

        If you use a Microsoft service, the you get your application ID on the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList) page. Click the name of your BotFramework bot, listed under the My Applications section.

    * `Space-separated list of scopes`: The list of scopes, separated by spaces.
    * `Authorization URL`: The authorization URL of your OAuth 2.0 provider.

        If you use a Microsoft service, then the authorization URL is:

        ```url
        https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
        ```

    * `Token options`: Possible values are `GET` or `POST`. Unless you have specific reasons to use GET, you should use POST.
    * `Grant type`: Possible values are `Authorization code` or `Implicit`.
    * `Token URL`: The token URL of your OAuth 2.0 provider.

        If you are using a Microsoft service, then set to the following value.

        https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token
        ```

    * `Client secret/password for third party services`: Your bot's password.  If you're using Microsoft Identity Service, then the password is generated when you register your bot in the *Microsoft Application Registration* portal.

        >[!IMPORTANT]
        > The password (client secret) is displayed only once. When you create your bot, it's shown under the *Application Secrets* section of the [Microsoft Application Registration](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList) portal.

        > If you don't know the password, you'll need to create a new one by clicking on the **Generate New password** button.

    * `Client authorization scheme`: If you don't know your client authorization scheme, use  the default option (`HTTP Basic (Recommended)`).

    * `This skill's Connected Service requires intranet access to authenticate users (leave this unchecked if you are unsure).` Check this only if your app requires access to an intranet.

    1. Request user profile data

You can confirm that your Cortana skill is deployed on the Bot Framework portal or Azure portal page by logging in with the same Microsoft account (MSA) that you registered in the *Bot Framework* portal.

## Test Group Settings

Deploying to **Test Group** makes your Cortana skill available to a group of users that you specify, using individual MSA email addresses. Typically, you create a test group to have others test your Cortana skill and provide feedback. It's a really good idea to test and update your skill before making it generally available.

The Cortana Certification Team reviews all third-party skills before they can be released. If the team has any concerns or questions during the review process, you will receive an email message at the address you specified. If it's rejected, then the details and reasons for rejection are provided. If all requirements are met, then your Cortana skill is accepted and deployed.

    >[!TIP]
    > If you encounter any technical issues and you require assistance, then please send an email message to [Cortana skills Kit Support@microsoft.com](mailto:skillsup@microsoft.com).

### Withdrawing Your Submission

Your Cortana skill is locked while the Certification Team is reviewing it. If you want to make changes to your skill, click on the **Withdraw your submission** button.

You may withdraw your Cortana skill only during the following stages.
- Prior to start of review
- During review
- After approval, but prior to publishing to the **World**

All the properties entered in **World Settings** are saved. You may update the publishing properties of your Cortana skill and resubmit for review and certification.

### Common Reasons for Review Failure

If you read and adhere to the [review requirements](./skill-review-guidelines.md), then your skill should pass the review.

Some common reasons why a Cortana skill fails the review are:

- The invocation name does not meet policy requirements.

- Your submission does not provide sample invocation phrases.  You must provide at least three sample invocation phrases that demonstrate your Cortana skill. Each of the samples should use a different phrase, such as `ask`, `open`, `tell`, etc.

- You provide sample phrases with one or more of the following issues.

    The phrase doesn't include a launch word (ask, tell, and so on) or an invocation name. For example, for a skill called **MyEvents**, these would be incorrect:

    + `MyEvents update` : Missing the launch word.
    + `Ask for an update` : Missing the invocation name.

- The samples do not work as expected or described. Before submitting your skill, you should ensure that the invocation phrases work as expected. Ideally, you should provide enough samples to demonstrate all key features.

- The skill does not provide support for help. Most first-time users will ask the skill for help (usually by saying "Help"). If a user asks for help, then your skill must tell the user how to use the skill.

    Your skill should also prompt the user for correct input if it cannot respond to what the user just entered.

    Example: If your skill involved checking stock prices, and the user failed to provide a stock name, your help could be "Please say the name of a stock. For example, say Contoso."

- Your skill infringes on the intellectual property (IP) of another company.

    The name and invocation name of your Cortana skill should not consist of any trademarked or copyrighted words unless you have permission from the owner. You must ensure that you have the right to share the content that your skill provides, and you must ensure that your skill doesn't make use of any unlicensed or pirated audio or visual content.

### Delete Channel

Deleting a Cortana skill involves deleting the channel inside the BotFramework portal.  To be able to delete the Cortana channel on a bot, the skill must not be currently published to **World**.

If you need to delete a Cortana skill that is published to **World**, then you must contact the Cortana Certification Team. If a skill is under review by the team, then you must first withdraw your submission before deleting the Cortana channel.

If your skill has not been published to **World**, you can delete the channel on the *Configure Cortana* page. At the bottom of all sections, click the **Delete Channel** button.

![Delete Channel](./media/images/delete_channel.png)
