# Using Cortana to access Connected Services
Cortana can manage OAuth 2 authentication with Microsoft services via Microsoft's Application (App) Registration process and Identity Access Manager, or third party resource access through OAuth 2 compliant App Registration and Identity Access Managers.

Please visit the [Azure AD App Registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
quickstart for details on how Azure App Registration works.
