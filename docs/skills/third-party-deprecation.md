# Deprecation of Cortana third-party skills

We will be retiring Cortana third-party skills on all Cortana endpoints in the first quarter of 2020.

## How does this change affect me?
If you are a new developer, you will not see the option to add a Cortana channel on the Channels configuration page.

If you are an existing developer who has a Cortana skill deployed to self, test, or world, the Cortana channel configuration page will be available to you over a 60-day period, beginning November 30, 2019. During this period, if you submit your skill for certification and it passes, it will be made available to the world. The last date to submit a skill for certification is January 23, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, Cortana will be removed from the Channels page as an available channel for all developers. Skills that are available to the world as of this date will continue to be live for the next 60 days. If you want to remove your skill during this period, you can contact us at skillpub@microsoft.com to have it taken down.

At the end of March 2020, all Cortana third-party skills will be deprecated and will no longer be available to the world.

If you have any questions , write to us at skillpub@microsoft.com.
