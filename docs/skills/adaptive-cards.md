# Use AdaptiveCards in Your Cortana Skill

Cards are interface elements that you can use to enhance the user experience in your Cortana skill. As with all cards, you can only use them when Cortana is running on a device with a display. See [Determine Cortana's device type](./cortana-device-type.md) for details on how to get device information.
  
An adaptive card is the most versatile display card. It's customizable, and can include any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields.  

## AdaptiveCards  

Adaptive cards provide the following options.  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|**Input controls** | Add input controls for text, date, number, time, toggle switch, and choice set.  |
|**Richer text** | Text in your card is not limited to title, subtitle, and text fixed formats. Use a variety of font sizes, formats, and colors. |
|**A single open card exchange format** | Use your existing cards in a common and consistent way and extend your cards with rich controls using a common schema.  |

AdaptiveCards use the open card exchange format. This format enables you to specify user interface content for all cards in your skill in a common and consistent way. You describe the content as a simple JSON object. The JSON content is natively displayed by the skill and automatically adapts to the look and feel of your skill.
 [!Note]
>Cortana currently supports Adaptive Cards version 1.0.

AdaptiveCards include elements, containers, actions, and inputs. A basic adaptive card includes:

* an adaptive card root object,
* an adaptive card body, which includes the elements of your card, and
* actions for your adaptive card, which are typically displayed in an action bar at the bottom of your card.  

## AdaptiveCards Designer

The [AdaptiveCards Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer) provides an interactive card builder where you can see the resulting card JSON data.

## Create an AdaptiveCard
You can create adaptive cards using `proxy pattern` helper classes in the [SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/), or by directly using JSON following the [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/card-schema).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 1. The speak object of an adaptive card msut be copied to the Message for Cortana to speak the text.
> 1. If it's not already, the speak object text must be wrapped in SSML `<speak>` tags.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

### Create using .NET

1. Install the `AdaptiveCards` NuGet package.
1. Specify the elements of your card in code.
1. Add the card to your Cortana skill as an attachment.

The following code adds an adaptive card to a Cortana skill response for Bot Framework V3.

 ```csharp
 var response = context.MakeMessage();

 AdaptiveCard card = new AdaptiveCard();

 card.Body.Add(new AdaptiveTextBlock()
     {
         Text = "This is a test",
         Weight = TextWeight.Bolder
         Size = TextSize.Medium,
     }
 );

 response.Attachments.Add(card.ToAttachment());

 await context.PostAsync(response);
 context.Wait(MessageReceived);
 ```  
# [JavaScript](#tab/js)

### Create using JavaScript

1. Install the `adaptivecards` [NPM package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/sdk/rendering-cards/javascript/getting-started) (optional)
1. Use JSON to build your card in code, or the proxy object from the `adaptivecards` package
1. Add the card to your skill as an attachment.

 ```javascript
let msg = new builder.Message(session)
// In JavaScript, JSON is integrated
msg.addAttachment({
    "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
    "content": {
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.0",
        "body": [{
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "This is a test",
            "size": "medium",
            "weight": "bolder"
        }]
    }
});
session.send(msg);
 ```

## Respond to AdaptiveCards
If you look at the [Calendar reminder](https://adaptivecards.io/samples/CalendarReminder.html) example on the AdaptiveCards website, you'll note that it has two `Action.Submit` buttons, one for the _Snooze_ response, and one for the _I'll be Late_ response.  For _Snooze_, there is a `Input.ChoiceSet` with standard values of 5, 10, and 15 minutes.

In our example, Cortana will say, _"Your meeting 'Adaptive Card design session' is starting at 12:30pm. Do you want to snooze or do you want to send a late notification to the attendees?"_  At the same time, she will display this card:

 ![Sample card](../media/images/calendar_reminder.png)  

Cortana skills should be designed for voice first, so consider this code that supports spoken replies like
- I'll be **late**
- **Snooze** for 10 minutes

based on simple keyword search (matches in bold).

You will receive a JSON `value` attached to the response message with the `data` properties of the `Action.Submit` buttons, along with any `Input` fields with their `id` and `value` fields.  Given this example, if the user clicks the _Snooze_ button, they'll see:

```
 "value": {
      "x": "snooze",  <-- the Action.Submit data
      "snooze": "5"   <-- the Input.ChoiceSet id and selected value
    }
```

[!IMPORTANT]
>Cortana responds differently depending on how the user responds. The example returns data in the JSON `value` because the user pressed the button on the card. If the response is spoken, there will be a `text` response on the message, but no `value`.  
>You should ignore the `text` property on the message if a `value` is present._ 
>Your code must handle both cases.

### Respond in C#
```C#
...
        // match 1 or 2 digits and white space and "minute"
        private static Regex regexMinutes = new Regex(@"(\d{1,2})\s+minute", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
...
                var message = await argument;
                var response = context.MakeMessage();

                string sValue = "unknown";

                if (message.Value != null)
                {
                    // Got an Action Submit
                    dynamic value = message.Value;
                    string xValue = (string)value.SelectToken("x");
                    if (xValue.Equals("snooze"))
                    {
